NOTE

1. Use of all data included in the paper was acknowledged.
    
    1.1 IMAGEN data was available by application to consortium coordinator Dr. Schumann (http://imagen-europe.com) after evaluation according to an established procedure.(DOI:10.1038/mp.2010.4)
    
    1.2 HCP S900 data was used in our study, which was provided by the WU-Minn Consortium. (Principal Investigators: David Van Essen and Kamil Ugurbil; 1U54MH091657) (DOI:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.05.041)
    
    1.3 The UK Biobank data was an open resource and available to researchers by registering and applying to access the Resource via the Resource Access Management System (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) (DOI:10.1038/nn.4393)

2.The aal2TC.mat and aal2FC.mat file were time courses and functional connectivity of samples in all three dataset. Global signal was NOT regressed out from the preprocessed data. The YMU_data.mat were functional connectivity of samples in Yang-Ming University dataset. All data were preprocessed by Weikang Gong, who was a colleague in our lab and currently a PhD student at University of Oxford. The pipeline descripted in the Method section were used to preprocess the data.

SUMMARY ï¼ˆMatlab2019a; PALM:https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/PALM)

step 1: Sex differences in global functional connectivity. (func1_sex_difference_of_gFC.m)

    step 1.1: Fitting localized spline curve for global functional connectivity without considering the covariates.
    
    step 1.2: Fitting localized spline curve considering the covariates.
    
    step 1.3: Comparison of different fitted spline curves.
    
    step 1.4: Validating the findings on gFC using YMU dataset.


step 2: Sex differences in local functional connectivity. (func2_local_sex_difference.m)

    step 2.1: Regional-level comparison of sex differences of functional connectivity.
  
    step 2.2: Network-level comparison of sex differences of functional connectivity.


step 3: Balancing training samples in two sexes and regressing out age and their higher order terms to make preparations for the training. (func3_model_training_preparation.m)

    step 3.1: Randomly choosing equal female and male subjects to keep the balance between two sexes in training samples.
  
    step 3.2: Regressing out age and their higher order terms from functional connectivity from training and test sets respectively.


step 4: Training and assessment of the performance of the SVM model. (func4_CV_and_testing_of_SVM_model.m)

    step 4.1: 10-fold cross validation assessment on UK Biobank dataset.
  
    step 4.2: Test set assessment on HCP dataset.


step 5: Testing the validity of the SVM model to make sure androgyny given by the SVM was between female and male rather than noise. (func5_validity_of_gender_continuum.m)


step 6: Sensitivity analysis of the SVM model. (func6_sensitivity_analysis.m)

    step 6.1: Changing sample size of training set, and test its influence on test accuracy.(calc_ss.m)
  
    step 6.2: Changing age configuration (percentage of training samples older than 65 years old), and test its influence on test accuracy.(calc65.m)
  
    step 6.3: Changing the age upper bound of training samples, and test its influence on test accuracy.
  
        step 6.3.1: Age and its higher order terms were regressed from the functional connectivity as what has been done in other part of the study.(calc_age_reg.m)
    
        step 6.3.2: Age and its higher order terms were not regressed from the functional connectivity to study the age effect on test accuracy.(calc_age_unreg.m)
    
    step 6.4: Excluding one brain network used in the model at a time, and test its influence on test accuracy.
  

step 7: Apply gender continuum given by the SVM model to internalizing problems. (func7_application.m)

    step 7.1: define the multi-level blocks according to family structure (perm_fam.csv) in the HCP S900 data, and generate the block permuted sample by calling the PALM function.
  
    step 7.2: correlation analysis (both linearly and quadratically) of the relationship between gender continuum and internalizing problems.
